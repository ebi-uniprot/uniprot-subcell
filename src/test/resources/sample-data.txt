ID   Membrane.
AC   SL-0162
DE   A membrane is a lipid bilayer which surrounds enclosed spaces and
DE   compartments. This selectively permeable structure is essential for
DE   effective separation of a cell or organelle from its surroundings.
DE   Membranes are composed of various types of molecules such as
DE   phospholipids, integral membrane proteins, peripheral proteins,
DE   glycoproteins, glycolipids, etc. The relative amounts of these
DE   components as well as the types of lipids are non-randomly distributed
DE   from membrane to membrane as well as between the two leaflets of a
DE   membrane.
SL   Membrane.

ID   Vesicle.
AC   SL-0498
DE   A vesicle is a small structure consisting of fluid enclosed by a lipid
DE   bilayer. Vesicles form naturally during the processes of secretion
DE   (exocytosis), uptake (endocytosis) and transport of materials within
DE   the cytoplasm or between cells, and exist both within the cell and in
DE   the extracellular space.
SL   Vesicle.

ID   Acrosome.
AC   SL-0007
DE   The acrosome is a large lysosome-like vesicle overlying the sperm
DE   nucleus. This spermatid specific organelle, derived from the Golgi
DE   during spermatogenesis, contains both unique acrosomal enzymes and
DE   common enzymes associated with lysosomes in somatic cells. Only sperm
DE   that have undergone the acrosome reaction can fuse with egg plasma
DE   membrane. The acrosome reaction is characterized by multiple fusions
DE   of the outer acrosomal membrane with the sperm cell membrane.

ID   Cytoplasmic vesicle.
AC   SL-0088
DE   The cytoplasmic vesicles mediate vesicular transport among the
DE   organelles of secretory and endocytic systems. These transport
DE   vesicles are classified by the identity of the protein coat used in
DE   their formation and also by the cargo they contain, e.g. clathrin-,
DE   COPI-, and COPII-coated vesicles, synaptic vesicles, secretory
DE   vesicles, phagosomes, etc.

HI   Vesicle.
KW   KW-0968
//
ID   Endomembrane system.
AC   SL-0147
DE   A collection of membranous structures involved in transport within the
DE   cell. The main components of the endomembrane system are endoplasmic
DE   reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vesicles and cell membrane and nuclear
DE   envelope. The endomembrane system does not include the membranes of
DE   mitochondria or plastids.
SY   Endomembrane.
SL   Endomembrane system.
HI   Membrane.

ID   Cytoplasmic vesicle membrane.
AC   SL-0089
DE   The membrane surrounding a cytoplasmic vesicle. The cytoplasmic
DE   vesicles mediate vesicular transport among the organelles of secretory
DE   and endocytic systems.

HI   Membrane.
HP   Cytoplasmic vesicle.
HP   Endomembrane system.
GO   GO:0030659; cytoplasmic vesicle membrane

ID   Secretory vesicle.
AC   SL-0244
DE   The secretory vesicle is a vesicle that mediates the vesicular
DE   transport of cargo - e.g. hormones or neurotransmitters - from an
DE   organelle to specific sites at the cell membrane, where it docks and
DE   fuses to release its content. It has been demonstrated that membrane-
DE   bound secretory vesicles dock and fuse at porosomes, which are
DE   specialized supramolecular structures at the cell membrane.
SY   Secretory granule.
SL   Cytoplasmic vesicle, secretory vesicle.
HI   Cytoplasmic vesicle.

//
IT   Lipid-anchor.
AC   SL-9901
DE   Protein bound to the lipid bilayer of a membrane through a
DE   posttranslationally modification by the attachment of at least one
DE   lipid or fatty acid, e.g. farnesyl, palmitate and myristate.
SL   Lipid-anchor.
